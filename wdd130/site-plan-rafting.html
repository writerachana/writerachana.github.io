    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3 style='font-weight:bold'> What is White Water Rafting?</h3>
    <p1>
        White Water Rafting, also still referred to by old timers as “River Running”, 
        is a popular recreational activity where a craft (typically a rubber raft) made for navigating whitewater rapids is navigated through 
        white water rapids for the sheer recreational joy of it. That purely recreational purpose is what defines white water rafting. 
        Every summer many thousands venture downriver on rafts for multiple days and nights, camping along the way. Many thousands more 
        participate in day trips, or half-day trips where available.
        The freedom and joy Mark Twain describes his fictional characters Jim and Huckleberry Finn feeling as they rafted 
        down the great Mississippi River, which was essentially a flat water float trip, approaches the feeling of white water rafting. 
        But for all their adventure, Jim and Huck did no white water rafting! Navigation by river for scientific, exploratory, or even 
        hunting and fishing purposes has been around since ancient times. But the recreational purpose for which a raft is taken down the 
        river is what white water rafting is all about! Today, there are hundreds of river outfitters ready to take you white water rafting - 
        one of the best outdoor experiences available on the planet!</p1>

    <h3 style='font-weight:bold'> What is it Like to Go White Water Rafting?</h3>
    <p2>
        Have you ever been backpacking, and know the thrill of getting into otherwise inaccessible landscapes with everything you need 
        right in your pack? Rafting is all the self-contained freedom of backpacking, with all the conveniences of car camping. Plus a 
        heckuva lot of fun in the white water! Even if you’re gone for just a day trip, you can immediately sense the wildness of being 
        afloat on a wild river, coupled with the endless suspense of wondering what’s around the next corner. On multi-day expeditions, 
        outfitters provide meals and other camp necessities like sleeping bags, pads, cots, etc. Generally, all you need to prepare is your 
        own personal duffle bag.
        “White water is only the punctuation to an overall poetic experience.” says Peter Grubb, a white water pioneer on the 
        great rivers of Idaho. In other words, many mistake rafting as something strictly for whitewater enthusiasts, or thrill-seekers.
         As for the thrill of conquering the white water rapids: it is unmistakably a team-building and bonding experience, not unlike f
         ighting a war battle to emerge victorious through each rapid, and at the end of the day. Those who gird up their loins for a 
         whitewater battle realize there’s so much more to a rafting vacation than they had ever anticipated. Perhaps that’s why white water
          vacations become so impactful - even life changing. The juxtaposition of adrenaline with relaxation in a wild setting, is… memorable. 
          There’s nothing quite like a river rafting trip!</p2>
