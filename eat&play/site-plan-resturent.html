      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Elevator Pitch 
        My goal is to open my own business. 
        I want the website to advertise my business.
        I open a restaurant business 
        My restaurant will sell goods as well as food and drinks of different kinds.
        My website will advertise this restaurant where people can choose their seats and food and dress online. 
        Think about it if you ever get an online restaurant service where you can see the result online and check which set you want to book or which foods you want on your table to be served. Or how you will look by wearing a dress on an online website? That is my website will be for the advertisement for various companies with unexpected designs.
