            <h1>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h1>
            <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age
                 of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 
                 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours 
                 at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through
                  are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner.
                   Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a 
                   guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling
                    stories...some of which are even true!</p>
